Generative Adversarial Network for doodle creation.

Images of sketches and photos downloaded from http://sketchy.eye.gatech.edu/. First 25 images of each category kept for reasonable RAM usage and repository size.

Discriminator discriminates sketched photos from photographs. Network for doodle generating coming soon.

Dependencies: python, numpy, scipy, tensorflow (gpu version recommended), pillow
